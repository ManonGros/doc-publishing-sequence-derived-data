# Contributing to this document

https://www.gbif.org[GBIF]—the Global Biodiversity Information Facility—has long been a source of technical documentation on a range of topics relating to biodiversity informatics and open biodiversity data. Building on the suggestions of the http://vertnet.org/[VertNet] team, GBIF began taking steps to clarify and improve its role in coordinating the development of such documentation in 2018, with the intent of engaging its community to collaborate with subject-matter experts to produce and use standardized documentation that is uniform, reliable, reusable, versioned, and easily updatable. 

We code our documents using https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[AsciiDoc] and apply http://dd.dgacm.org/editorialmanual/[United Nations style and spelling conventions] (tl;dr: British English with -ize endings).

## What are we looking for?

GBIF's digital documents are designed to encourage and support input from the biodiversity informatics community on key guidance materials.
