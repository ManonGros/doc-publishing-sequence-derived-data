This repository can be cloned to create the structure for maintaining up-to-date, community-curated documentation for the GBIF network on GitHub.

All documentation should be written in [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/), a lightweight plain-text format that supports the structural elements needed for producing technical documentation from the same source content in both digital and print formats (see this [helpful quick reference guide for AsciiDoc formatting](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference)).
